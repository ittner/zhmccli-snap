# zhmccli-snap

This is a snap for zhmccli, a CLI application written in pure Python that interacts with the Hardware Management Console (HMC) of IBM Z LinuxONE machines. The goal of this package is to provide an easy-to-use command line interface for operators.

The zhmccli package uses the API provided by the zhmcclient package, which interacts with the Web Services API of the HMC. It supports management of the lifecycle and configuration of various platform resources, such as partitions, CPU, memory, virtual switches, I/O adapters, and more.
